How do you put normal writing, analysis, code and output into one file in a simple way? Enter RMarkdown/Quarto! Throughout this semester you will deliver your projects in the form of a RMarkdown or Quarto file. There are several cool options when you use this type of output, but I will only briefly describe what you need submit your work. You are encourage to dig deeper if you want to [here for RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) and [here for Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html). I will focus here on Quarto for practical purposes. 

> RMarkdown and Quarto are almost the same thing for our purposes. Quarto is a new tool that the folks from RStudio developed, but it uses pretty much the same format as RMarkdown, so I will use them interchangably. 

## How to create an output file 

There are several options when creating a Quarto file. You would go to the New file symbol (white page with green plus), and select the **Quarto Document** option

```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/quarto_newfile.png")
```

Then you select the title for the project you want to create, and add your name for the authorship. Leave all other default options unchanged, including the HTML option. Then click **Create**

```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/quarto_newdocument.png")
```

You should have a new Quarto document now. Save it a name by clicking on the floppy disk.

Now just try to render the file. This will create the final output in a readable fashion. To do that, click on **Render** (it as a blue arrow on the top). 

### Error when rendering file

Maybe you clicked on **Render** and got this message in the **Background Jobs" tab, by the console: 

```
Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘jsonlite’
Calls: .main ... loadNamespace -> withRestarts -> withOneRestart -> doWithOneRestart
Execution halted

R installation:
  Version: 4.2.1
  Path: /opt/R/4.2.1/lib/R
  LibPaths:
    - /cloud/lib/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.2
    - /opt/R/4.2.1/lib/R/library
  rmarkdown: (None)

The rmarkdown package is not available in this R installation.
Install with install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

If that is the case, it's because the package `rmarkdown` is not installed. So go ahead and install it by running: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

Now click on **Render** once more. It should work, and you should see a new html window with your document. 

Once you Render you should see a new pop up window with the output html site, in which this example, would be something like this: 

```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/quarto_output.png")
```

You will also this in the tab **Background Jobs**:

```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/quarto_finaldoc.png")
```

Notice the text after *Browse at:*. That is an address that you can use to watch the final output if you cannot see it anymore. 

## Add new code

You add code by adding 'chunks' of code. You do that by clicking on **Insert**, then **Code Chunk**, and then **R**.

Also, notice that if you add to the first line of the chunk a line like this `#| echo:false`, then when you render you will not see the code, but only the output of the code. This is convenient when the output is too long or distracting, or when you don't want to show the code necessarily. 

```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/quarto_codechunk.png")
```

## Add a title

If you want to add a new title, just type in the main text the following `## ` (notice the space), and that will give you a Header (or title). You can get subtitles by typing three instead of two pound symbols: `### `. 

## Add an image

What if you want to add an image? For example, you might have downloaded an image like this from the Opportunity Atlas website:

```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fips_tract.png")
```

How do you add it? Well, you need to do it in two steps. The first, is to **upload** the image to the directory. To do that, go to the **Files** tab, and click on **Upload**, and select your image:

```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/quarto_imageupload.png")
```

```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/quarto_imageupload2.png")
```

You should now see your image in the **Files** tab. Now, you can add the image to the document by clicking on the image symbol on the top (close to the **Insert** option). Then browse and select the image you just uploaded, add a caption for it, and add it. You should then see it in the main document. 

```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/quarto_imageupload3.png")
```

```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/quarto_imageupload4.png")
```

## Submit your work

There is no need to submit anything for [Project 1](#project1). I will check the RStudio site on Thursday morning, and check your progress on project 1.
