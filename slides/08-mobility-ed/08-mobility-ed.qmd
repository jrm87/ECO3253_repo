- K-12 Education Review 
- Education Production Function

# K-12 Education 

## K-12 Education: Background

- U.S. spends nearly $1 trillion per year on K-12 education

- Decentralized system with substantial variation across schools

    - Public schools funded by local property taxes  sharp differences in funding across areas

    - Private schools and growing presence of charter schools

## K-12 Education: Overview

- Main question: how can we maximize the effectiveness of this system to produce the best outcomes for students?

    - Traditional approach to study this question: qualitative work in schools

    - More recent approach: analyzing big data to evaluate impacts

## Using Test Score Data to Study K-12 Education

- Primary source of big data on education: standardized test scores obtained from school districts

    - Quantitative outcome recorded in existing administrative databases for virtually all students

    - Observed much more quickly than long-term outcomes like college attendance and earnings


## Using Test Score Data to Evaluate Primary Education

- Common concern: are test scores a good measure of learning?

    - Do improvements in test scores reflect better test-taking ability or acquisition of skills that have value later in life?

- Chetty et al. (2011) examine this issue using data on 12,000 children who were in Kindergarten in Tennessee in 1985

    - Link school district and test score data to tax records

    - Ask whether KG test score performance predicts later outcomes


## A Kindergarten Test

## Studying Differences in Test Score Outcomes

- Test scores can provide a powerful data source to compare performance across schools and subgroups (e.g., poor vs. rich)

- Problem: tests are not the same across school districts and grades 
    - $\rightarrow$ makes comparisons very difficult

- Reardon et al. (2016) solve this problem and create a standardized measure of test score performance for all schools in America

    - Use 215 million test scores for students from 11,000 school districts across the U.S. from 2009-13 in grades 3-8

## Making Test Score Scales Comparable Across the U.S.

- Convert test scores to a single national scale in three steps:

    1. Rank each school district’s average scores in the statewide distribution (for a given grade-year-subject)

    2. Use data from a national test administered to a sample of students by Dept. of Education to convert state-specific rankings to national scale

        - Ex: suppose CA students score 5 percentiles below national average

        - Then a CA school whose mean score is 10 percentiles below CA mean is 15 percentiles below national mean

    3. Convert mean test scores to “grade level” equivalents

## Achievement Gaps in Test Scores by Socioeconomic Status

- Next, use these data to examine how test scores vary across socioeconomic groups

- Define an index of socioeconomic status (SES) using Census data on income, fraction of college graduates, single parent rates, etc.

## Academic Achievement and SES 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}

```

## Academic Achievement and SES 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec7_k12/academicses3.png")
```


## How Can We Improve Poorly Performing Schools?

- There are many school districts in America where students are two grade levels behind national average, controlling for SES

- How can we improve performance in these schools?

    - Simply spending more money on schools is not necessarily the solution…

## Test Scores vs. Expenditures on Primary Education Across Countries

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec7_k12/test_exp.png")
```

## Two Policy Paradigms to Improve Schools

- Two distinct policy paradigms to improve schools

    1. Government-based solutions: improve public schools by reducing class size, increasing teacher quality, etc.

    2. Market-based solutions: charter schools or vouchers for private schools

- Contentious policy debate between these two approaches

- We will consider each approach in turn

# Government-Based Solutions: Improving Schools

## Improving Schools: The Education Production Function

- Improving public schools requires understanding the education production function

- How should we change schools to produce better outcomes?

    - Better Teachers?
    - Smaller Classes?
    - Better Technology?

## Effects of Class Size: Tennessee STAR Experiment

- Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) experiment

    - Conducted from 1985 to 1989 in Tennessee

    - About 12,000 children in grades K-3 at 79 schools

- Students and teachers randomized into classrooms within schools

    - Class size differs: small (~15 students) or large (~22 students)

    - Classes also differ in teachers and peers

## Effects of Class Size: Tennessee STAR Experiment

- Evaluate impacts of STAR experiment by comparing mean outcomes of students in small vs. large classes.

- Report impacts using regressions of outcomes on an indicator (0-1 variable) for being in a small class [Krueger 1999, Chetty et al. 2011]

knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec7_k12/star6.png")
```

## Effects of Class Size: Quasi-Experimental Evidence

- Limitation of STAR experiment: sample is too small to estimate impacts of class size on earnings precisely

- Fredriksson et al. (2013) use administrative data from Sweden to obtain more precise estimates

    - No experiment here; instead use a quasi-experimental method: regression discontinuity.

## Regression Discontinuity Using Class Size Cutoffs

- Sweden imposes a maximum class size of 25 students

    - School that has 26 students in a given grade will therefore have two classes of 13 students each

    - School that has 25 students may have one class of 25 students

- School that have 26 students in a grade are likely to be comparable to those that have 25 students

    - $\rightarrow$ Can identify causal effects of class size by comparing outcomes in schools with 26 vs. 25 students in a given grade

## Lessons on Class Size

- Reducing class sizes in primary school by hiring more teachers can have large returns

    - Present value of lifetime earnings of a child growing up in a family at 25th percentile is about $500,000 on average

    - 4% earnings gain from smaller class = $20,000

    - Dividing a class of 30 students into two would increase total earnings of students by more than $600,000

    - Costs (hiring another teacher and an additional room) likely to be well below $600,000
