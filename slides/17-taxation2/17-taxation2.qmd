- Behavioral Public Economics

Three examples: 

1. Sales tax
2. Income taxation
3. Savings and retirement

# Behavioral Public Economics

## Behavioral Public Economics

- Traditional economic approach assumes that all individuals are fully aware of taxes that they pay and optimize perfectly in response

- Is this true in practice? 

    - Do you know your marginal income tax rate? 

    - Do you think about it when choosing a job?  When deciding how much to save for retirement?

```{r, echo=FALSE, source="Gruber (2016)", out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec17_tax2/pages_gruber.png")
```

## Behavioral Public Economics Example 1: Sales Taxes

- Begin by considering one of the simplest taxes: sales taxes on purchases in grocery stores

- Chetty, Looney, Kroft (2009) test whether consumers are aware of and respond “rationally” to these simple taxes

- Sales taxes not included in posted prices in the U.S.

- Test whether this affects response to sales taxes using an experiment in a grocery store in Northern California

## The experiment

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec17_tax2/chetty_exp_fig2.png")
```


## Behavioral Public Economics Example 2: Income Taxation

- Next, turn to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC): largest cash transfer anti-poverty program in the U.S.

    - $70 billion spent per year, partly with goal of increasing work among low-income families

    - Is the EITC successful in achieving this goal?

- Chetty, Friedman, and Saez (2013) study this question, focusing on importance of knowledge and information about EITC

## 2008 Federal EITC Schedule for a Single Filer with Children

```


## Is the Spatial Variation Driven by Differences in Knowledge About the EITC?

- Is the spatial variation in EITC response driven by differences in knowledge or other factors, such as differences in tax compliance?

- Knowledge explanation makes a very specific prediction: asymmetric impact of moving

    - Moving to a higher-bunching neighborhood should increase responsiveness to EITC as people learn

    - But moving to a lower-bunching area should not affect responsiveness

## Event Study of Sharp Bunching Around Moves

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec17_tax2/chetty_eitc10.png")
```


## Change in EITC Refunds vs. Change in Sharp Bunching for Movers

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec17_tax2/chetty_eitc11.png")
```


## Reporting vs. Real Responses

- Audit studies reveal that sharp bunching at EITC refund maximizing threshold is partly due to misreporting of self-employment income

- To isolate real work responses, focus on wage earnings reported on W-2 firms directly by employers

## Income Distribution For Single Wage Earners with One Child

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}

## Earnings Distribution in the Year Before First Child Birth for Wage Earners 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec17_tax2/chetty_eitc16.png")
```


## Implications for Design of Earned Income Tax Credit

- EITC has significant impacts on labor supply of low-income families with kids

    - But knowledge about the program plays a big role in determining its impacts 

    - If we want to amplify impacts of EITC on labor supply, may be more effective to increase awareness (or include in pre-tax wage) than change credit amount


## Behavioral Public Economics Example 3: Retirement Savings

- Widespread concern that many families are not saving enough for retirement

- U.S. government effectively spends $100 billion on programs to increasing saving for retirement

    - Subsidies for retirement savings accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s

- Is this an effective way to increase retirement saving? 

- Are there other policy instruments that may be more effective?

- Insights from behavioral economics has shifted policy approaches to increasing saving significantly in the past 15 years

## The Power of Defaults

- Madrian and Shea (2001) analyze impacts of employer defaults on individuals' 401(k) retirement account contributions

- Defaults just change whether employees opt-in or opt-out of retirement saving

- Do not change actual incentives to save, so should have no impact under traditional economic model

## Effects of Automatic Enrollment on 401(k) Participation

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec17_tax2/madrian1.png")
```


## Effects of Automatic Enrollment on Distribution of 401(k) Contribution Rates

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec17_tax2/madrian2.png")
```


## Crowdout in Retirement Savings Accounts

- Do defaults increase total savings or just lead to shifting of assets from non-retirement to retirement accounts?

- Impacts of defaults on total saving not obvious despite Madrian and Shea evidence

    - Even inattentive individuals still have to satisfy budget constraint by cutting consumption or savings in non-retirement accounts

-  Chetty et al. (2014) analyze this question using third-party reported data on all financial wealth for population of Denmark

## Impacts of Defaults in Denmark

- Employers make pension contributions on workers behalf automatically

- Contributions vary substantially across employers

- Research design: event study when workers switch firms

    - Retirement savings rate can change sharply when workers switch firms

    - Do workers offset these changes in their own private savings?

## Event Study around Switches to Firm with $>3\%$ Increase in Employer Pension Rate

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec17_tax2/chetty_pensions1.png")
```


## Event Study around Switches to Firm with $>3\%$ Increase in Employer Pension Rate

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec17_tax2/chetty_pensions2.png")
```


## Event Study around Switches to Firm with $>3\%$ Increase in Employer Pension Rate

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec17_tax2/chetty_pensions3.png")
```


## Impacts of Retirement Savings Subsidies

- Next, compare these effects to impacts of standard tax incentives for retirement saving

- Denmark subsidizes individual’s contributions to retirement accounts, analogous to 401(k)’s in the U.S.

- Reform in 1999 in Denmark lowered subsidy for saving in pension accounts by 12 cents per DKr for individuals in top income tax bracket

- Ask two questions analogous to those above:

    - How did this reform affect contributions to pension accounts?

    - How much money was shifted to other non-retirement accounts?

## Impact of 1999 Pension Subsidy Reduction On Pension Contributions

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}

## Impact of 1999 Pension Subsidy Reduction On Pension Contributions

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}

```


## Impact of 1999 Pension Subsidy Reduction On Pension Contributions

```


## Impact of 1999 Pension Subsidy Reduction On Pension Contributions

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec17_tax2/chetty_pensions8.png")
```


## Impact of 1999 Pension Subsidy Reduction On Pension Contributions

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec17_tax2/chetty_pensions9.png")
```


## Change in Marginal Propensity to Save in Retirement vs. Non-Retirement Accounts at Top Tax Cutoff by Year

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec17_tax2/chetty_pensions10.png")
```


## Change in Marginal Propensity to Save in Retirement vs. Non-Retirement Accounts at Top Tax Cutoff by Year

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec17_tax2/chetty_pensions11.png")
```


## Active vs. Passive Savers

- 15$\%$ of people account for entire reduction in pension contributions following reform (“active savers”)

    - But these people simply shift money from retirement account to other accounts, with essentially no net change in total saving

- 85$\%$ of people do not respond to incentives at all (“passive savers”)

    - These people are heavily influenced by defaults and increase total saving in response

## Heterogeneity in Responses to Subsidies by Educational Attainment

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec17_tax2/chetty_pensions12.png")
```


## Implications for Retirement Savings Policies

- Tax incentives for retirement saving have little impact on total savings because they simply induce active savers to switch accounts

    - \$1 of expenditures by government on retirement savings incentives generates only 1 cent of additional saving

- Automatic contributions/defaults have much larger impacts because they influence the behavior of passive savers

- Behavioral economics perspective calls for shift toward automatic enrollment plans and reductions in existing 401(k)-style incentives
