## Measuring Teacher Quality: Test-Score Based Metrics

- One prominent measure of teacher quality: teacher value-added

- How much does a teacher raise her/his students’ test scores on average?

## Debate About Teacher Value-Added Measures

- Controversial and highly politicized debate about using teacher value-added (VA) measures to evaluate teachers

- At its core, debate revolves around three statistical issues:

    1. Potential for bias in VA estimates

        - Do differences in test-score gains across teachers capture causal impacts of teachers or are they driven by student sorting?
    
    2. Lack of evidence on teachers’ long-term impacts

        - Do teachers who raise test scores improve students’ long-term outcomes or are they simply better at teaching to the test?
    3. Instability of VA estimates

        - Are estimates of teacher quality based on a few years of data too unstable to be useful for policy?

## Measuring the Impacts of Teachers

- Ideal experiment to answer these questions: randomly assign students to teachers with different value-added

- Test whether those with high value-added teachers have higher test scores and earnings

- Chetty and co-authors use a quasi-experimental approximation to this experiment

    - Exploit the fact that there is a lot of turnover in teachers across school years

    - When high VA teachers arrive at new schools, do scores go up?

    - Methodology: event-study designs

## A Quasi-Experiment: Entry of High Value-Added Teacher

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec8_teachers_charters/tva1.png")
```

## A Quasi-Experiment: Entry of Low Value-Added Teacher

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec8_teachers_charters/tva2.png")
```

## Lesson 1: VA Estimates Are Unbiased Measures of Teacher Effectiveness


- Students assigned to higher value-added teachers have higher test scores

    - Being assigned to a teacher who is predicted to raise test scores by 10 percentiles increases a given student’s score by $\sim$ 10 percentiles

    - Differences in VA measures largely capture _causal effects_ of teachers, not differences in types of students they are assigned (selection)

## Effect of Teacher Quality on College Attendance Rates

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec8_teachers_charters/tva3.png")
```

## Effect of Teacher Quality on Earnings

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec8_teachers_charters/tva4.png")
```

## Effect of Teacher Quality on Teenage Birth Rates

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec8_teachers_charters/tva5.png")
```

## Lesson 2: VA Estimates Based on Test Scores Predict Teachers’ Long-Term Impacts

- Assigning a student to a higher value-added teacher raises not just test scores but long-term outcomes

    - Teachers who generate high test scores are not just “teaching to the test”

## The Value of Improving Teacher Quality

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec8_teachers_charters/tva_dist1.png")
```


## The Value of Improving Teacher Quality

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec8_teachers_charters/tva_dist2.png")
```

## Reliability of Teacher Value-Added Estimates

- Previous calculation overstates feasible gain because we do not observe each teacher’s value-added perfectly

- In practice, we usually have performance data for just a couple of years before we need to make personnel decisions

    - VA estimates based on a couple of classes are statistically imprecise

    - Teachers who happen to have students who do well by chance will get a high VA score

- Does this estimation error in VA reduce gains from previous exercise?

## Selecting Teachers on the Basis of Value-Added Estimates

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec8_teachers_charters/tva_dist3.png")
```

## Selecting Teachers on the Basis of Value-Added Estimates

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec8_teachers_charters/tva_dist4.png")
```

## Earnings Gain from Teacher Replacement Based on Estimated VA

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec8_teachers_charters/earninggains.png")
```

## Lesson 3: VA Estimates Based on a Few Years of Data Are Sufficiently Reliable to Generate Large Gains on Average

- VA estimates do fluctuate depend upon which students teachers get

- But even taking this into account, gains from replacing teacher with estimated VA in bottom 5% with teacher of average quality is $250,000 

    - Less than $400,000 gain we’d achieve if there were no measurement error in VA, but still substantial

## Relevance of Findings to Current Policy Debate

- Most school districts in the U.S. do not use any performance metrics to evaluate teachers

    - In many districts, 98%+ of teachers get tenure within 3 years

    - Pay set purely based on experience, not performance

- New evidence on VA metrics has sparked interest in changing this system and finding ways to recruit and retain best teachers more effectively

## Summary: Improving Public Schools

- New data show that changing public schools in certain specific ways can have large long-term returns

- Reducing class size can be very valuable

    - But critical to hire highly effective new teachers when doing so

- There are large, measurable differences in teacher quality, 

    - We should do more to attract and retain top teachers in public schools (not just using value-added metrics but also other tools)

# Marked-Based Solutions: Charter Schools

## Market-Based Solutions to Improving Education

- Alternative approach to improving education: leverage market forces

- Permit school choice $\rightarrow$ best schools will attract more students and other schools will improve their performance to stay in business

- Two ways we currently take such an approach in the U.S.

    1. Charter schools: schools that are publicly funded but independent of public school system

    2. Vouchers that students can use for private schools instead of their local public school

## Do Charter Schools Work?

- **Question**: are private schools/charter schools better than public schools?

- Cannot simply compare outcomes at charters and public schools

    - Charters tend to be concentrated in lower-income, urban areas $\rightarrow$ outcomes worse on average

## Do Charter Schools Work?

- Several recent studies estimate effects of charter schools on students’ outcomes by exploiting lotteries for admission

    - Charter schools often have more applicants than seats  use lotteries to assign seats

    - Comparing outcomes of winners vs. losers identifies causal effects

## Effects of Boston Area Charter Schools

- Abdulkadiroglu et al. (2011): compare effects of charter schools and pilot schools in Boston

    - Charter schools are exempt from all public school regulations

    - Pilot schools are like charters but covered by Boston Public School regulations and teachers union contracts

    - Both are financed by payments from students' home district: tax payments transferred to charter/pilot school

```

## Effects of Boston Area Charter Schools

- Subsequent study by Angrist et al. (2013) shows that Boston charters have significant effects on college attendance rates

- Lesson: charters generate positive effects on average; pilots are no better than public schools

- Suggests that the flexibility obtained by relaxing public school restrictions (e.g., on teacher hiring) is a key driver of positive impacts

## Effects of Charter Schools: Summary

- Chabrier et al. (2016) summarize literature on charter schools

    - Small positive mean effects on test scores on average

    - In general, “no excuses" schools (extra hours, discipline, academic focus) tend to have positive impacts

## Market Competition and Charter Schools

- Does market discipline lead to growth of better schools and improvement in performance over time?

- Baude, Casey, Hanushek, and Rivkin (2014) study how quality of charter schools in Texas changed over time

## Market Competition and Charter Schools

- Charter school market is evolving in a positive direction

    - Better schools gaining enrollment over time

    - But still a number of relatively low-performing schools, even many years after system began

## Limitations of Market Competition

- Three limitations of relying purely on private market competition

    1. Markets may function poorly when quality is not well observed

        - Difficult to gauge value-added, especially when outcomes (e.g. college, earnings) are realized 10+ years after treatment

## Limitations of Market Competition

- Three limitations of relying purely on private market competition

    2. Cream skimming of students and teachers

        - Private schools have an incentive to reject less qualified applicants

        - Can exacerbate inequality by leaving less qualified students behind in schools with fewer resources and weaker peers

## Limitations of Market Competition

- Three limitations of relying purely on private market competition

    3. Parents may not make well-informed choices

        - Hastings, Kane, and Staiger (2007) study introduction of school choice in Charlotte, NC in 2002

        - Low income parents are much less likely to choose schools with high test scores than high income parents

        - School choice can _amplify_ achievement gaps

## Improving Primary Education: Summary

- We now have simple, empirically proven ways to improve primary education

    - Solutions range across political spectrum: more resources to reduce class size in public schools to expansion of “no excuses” charter schools

- Which approach is better: government or market based?

    - Current constraints in public school system (local property tax funding base, regulations on teacher hiring) limit its effectiveness

    - But unregulated market system likely to deliver highly variable outcomes

- Best system may be a hybrid that preserves flexibility within schools while offering uniform quality and resources across schools
