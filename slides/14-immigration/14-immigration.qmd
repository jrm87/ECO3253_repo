# Immigration

## Background

- Very little growth in median real wages for last 40 years
- Male wages: about the same now as in 1974
- Female wages: slow growth since 2000

## Background

- Stagnant wages $\rightarrow$ people age 20-50 earn no more than their parents

- And many earn less

- Did something ‘go wrong’ in US labor market? Technology? International trade? Immigration? 

## First and Second Generation Shares of US Population (Actual and Projected)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec11_immigration/immigratgion_stock.png")
```

## Percent of immigrants by OECD country (2013)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec11_immigration/immigratgion_stock_oecd.png")
```

## How many immigrants?

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec11_immigration/table1.png")
```

## Top Source Countries

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec11_immigration/table2.png")
```

Other big sources: El Salvador, Cuba, Korea

## Importance of Education Differences

Immigration from different places could have differential effects for each group of natives: 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec11_immigration/table3.png")
```

## Other differences

- Immigrants are clustered in cities/states

    - LA/Miami/TX border: 50%+ immigrant

    - NY/Boston/SF/Chicago: 20%+

    - Pittsburgh/Cleveland: <10%

    - Many rural areas: 2-5%

- Also clustered in jobs/sectors: 

    - Agriculture, food processing: 50%+

    - Health care: 30%

## Why do imms come to US? Supply side

- Rich countries: highly skilled workers most likely want to come to US (lower taxes, very high wages at the top)

- Poor countries: many people would earn more in the US – but gains largest for least skilled

- US immigration combines: high skill (H1-B), family based, low-skill demand (H2-A), and unauthorized

- Different than Canada/Aus/NZ

## Demand side: (1) at the top of skill distribution

- Increasing demand for highly-educated workers throughout 20th C. and into 21st

- Growth in new college grads slowed in 1970s (esp. for men) and has never fully recovered

    - Limited expansion in public sector slots

- Shortfalls in STEM

## Demand side: (2) at the bottom of skill distribution

- High demand for low-wage services

- Relative few regulations that limit low-wage jobs

- Low wage jobs subsidized by EITC, health insurance subsidies

- Flexible institutions (e.g. subcontracting) tolerance for untaxed/undocumented workes

## Insights

- Supply/demand and institutional policies are all adopted to supply 2 main groups: 

    - High skilled imms (mostly Asian, European)

    - Low skilled imms (mostly South and Central America, some Asian)

- They are targeting different jobs!

## How do immigrants affect Labor Markets?:

- Most people intuition: 
    - More people $\rightarrow$ lower wages

- This idea was proposed by Malthus in 1826 (or more recently by Thanos in Avengers)

- But: 
    - Larger countries do not have lower income
    - Larger cities typically have higher pay
    - Many countries try to promote population growth and immigration!
    
## How do immigrants affect Labor Markets?:

- Malthus was thinking of the medieval world with fixed land

- In the late 1800s it was pointed out that as long as capital expand with population, you can avoid Malthusian trap

- Increase in population by itself does no mean doom! (Thanos was wrong…)

## First order effects of immigration

- Rise in labor force leads to increase in investment, wages unaffected if K/L stays on trend

- In fact, many economic models suggest ‘size matters’: larger economy is more productive

- What is the historical record of K/L?

## Long Run Trend in Capital per Unit of Labor

```{r, echo=FALSE, source="BLS Multifactor Productivity Tables ", out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec11_immigration/KL1.png")
```


## What happens to capital after big increase in population?

- Best example is in Israel: increase of 25% in population in 1990 from former Soviet Union

- Labor ratio goes back on track soon after

## What happens to capital after big increase in population?

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec11_immigration/KL_synth_israel.png")
```


## Methodology: Synthetic Controls

- Can we say something of causal effects when the number of observations is small? 

- Say because we are looking at aggregates? 
    
    - To see the effect of a policy in a state, we can only have a total of 50 states

- Synthetic Controls averages other observations ‘not-treated’ with specific weights so that the Synthetic Control and the treated unit look the same in the period before the intervention and along other characteristics. 

- The estimated effects are the difference between treated unit and synthetic control. 

## What about different skill groups?

- As we saw, US immigration flows include excess shares of workers from the bottom and top

- Does this matter? Maybe…

- Agreement on 2 major skill groups

    A) Bottom + lower-middle
    B) Upper-middle + top

- Imms and natives nearly equal in these two groups

## Different types of evidence

A)

- Cross-city comparisons: Immigrants are clustered in selected cities: 

- On average: more immigrants -> more low education workers in city

- But relative wages of lowest-education natives are very stable across cities

- Comparison enhanced by isolating ‘supply push’ components of immigrant inflow to different cities

## Inflows of Mexican Immigrants  vs. the Change in Relative Wages of Native Male Dropouts

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec11_immigration/city_wage_changes.png")
```

## Even using feature of composition of imms gives same answer

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec11_immigration/card17.png")
```

## Different types of evidence

B)

- Big shocks  - Mariel Boatlift (1980)

- Arrival of about 150,000 Cuban migrants to Miami in a few months

    - Non-English speaking, low skilled

- Many stayed

- What happened to wages in Miami?


## Miami vs Synthetic Miami

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec11_immigration/peri_yasenov.png")
```

## Miami vs Synthetic Miami

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec11_immigration/peri_yasenov2.png")
```

## Similar evidence

B) 

- Big shocks in reverse:

- Mexican ‘Repatriation’ program, 1929 – 1937

- 400-500k Mexican imms and 2nd generation removed

- Brownsville, El Paso : 24% loss of labor force

- Anaheim, Tucson: 10% loss

- Lee, Peri and Yasenov (2017) find no effect on ‘native’ employment, unemployment. 

    - If anything, where more people left, there are lower wages

## What about mobility of immigrant population?

- So, no effect on native population. 

- How do immigrants do in terms of mobility versus natives?

- Abramitzky, Boustan, Jacome and Perez (2019) use millions of father-son pairs across more than 100 years of US history

- Big recent study using same (and more) big data as Chetty et al (2017) + GSS Survey to capture unauthorized immigrants

Findings: 

- Immigrant have higher mobility than natives. That advantage is similar today as it was historically (even if sending countries are changing)

- Advantage explained by immigrants moving to areas with better prospect for their kids and ‘under placement’ of the first generation

## Cross-Sectional Earning Gaps for First and Second-Generation Imms and US-born men by Country of Origin

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec11_immigration/abramitzky1.png")
```


## Cross-Sectional Earning Gaps for First and Second-Generation Imms and US-born men by Country of Origin

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec11_immigration/abramitzky2.png")
```

## Cross-Sectional Earning Gaps for First and Second-Generation Imms and US-born men by Country of Origin

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec11_immigration/abramitzky3.png")
```

## Intergenerational mobility of Imms and US-born (rank-rank)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/lec11_immigration/abramitzky4.png")
```

## Conclusion

- No evidence of effects on native population (at most are small)

- Evidence of gains for migrant population, and to aggregate productivity in many cases

- So, what explains many native’s attitudes of opposition (or deep ambivalence) to immigration? 

- Not necessarily the economics of it. 

- We will explore it more on next lecture on political economy
