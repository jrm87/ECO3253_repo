## Acknowledgements

I build this course based on the contributions of many teams and individuals. 

First, the intro and R components are mainly based on the material put up by the folks at Northwester (Chester Ismay, Albert Y. Kim, Arend M. Kuyper, Elizabeth Tipton, and Kaitlyn G. Fitzgerald). They build this great resource for [Intro to Statistics and Data Science](https://nulib.github.io/moderndive_book/index.html). That team, in turn, build their site based on the contribution of the Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim, who constructed the amazing online book [Modern Dive](https://moderndive.netlify.app/).

Second, I have also adopted a big chunk of the lectures put up by [Raj Chetty](https://rajchetty.com/) and the [Opportunity Insights](https://opportunityinsights.org/) team at Harvard, which can be found [here](https://opportunityinsights.org/course/).
