## Using Google DataCommons to Predict Social Mobility  {-}

- **Posted**: Thursday, November 17, 2022

- **Due**: Midnight on Friday, December 2, 2022

You have already explored the [Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org/) in [Project 1](#project1) and the [Social Capital Atlas](https://socialcapital.org/). In this this empirical project, you will use the Opportunity Atlas mapping tool and the underlying data, plus data from [Google DataCommons](https://www.datacommons.org/), to predict intergenerational mobility using **machine learning** methods. The measure of intergenerational mobility that we will focus on, as usual, is the mean rank of a child whose parents were at the 25th percentile of the national income distribution in each county (`kfr_pooled_p25`). Your goal is to construct the best predictions of this outcome using other variables, an important step in creating forecasts of upward mobility that could be used for future generations, before data on their outcomes become available.

I am passing along a “training” dataset, made of a random sample of 70% of all neighborhoods in the original Opportunity Atlas (`train.rds`). You will use predictors, presented in **Table 1**, to predict the variable `kfr_pooled_p25`. There are 121 predictors in these data. Obviously, you do not need to use all the 121 variables for your prediction. You then need to test your model on the 50% that I have passed along in a different file for testing (`test.rds`).

**Important!**

You do not need to use all the variables in atlas_training for your prediction! Follow the instructions for each question.
::::

You can load the data by using the following code:

```{r eval=FALSE}
train<- readRDS(gzcon(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jrm87/ECO3253_repo/master/data/atlas_train.rds")))
test<-readRDS(gzcon(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jrm87/ECO3253_repo/master/data/atlas_test.rds")))
```

## Instructions {-}

As usual, you will work on RStudio Cloud for this project. Write your responses within a [Quarto/RMarkdown here](#rmarkdown) file in the **project4** tab in RStudio Cloud.

### Specific questions  {-}

1.	Load the `atlas_training.rds` file. 

2.	Produce simple summary statistics (mean and standard deviation) for the 10 predictors you selected from the data and `krf_pooled_p25`. 

3.	Run a linear regression of `krf_pooled_p25` using only 10 predictors, inspect the results, and comment on what you findings. That is, interpret the predicted changes in mobility as your 10 predictors change. 

4.	How well does your linear regression predict `krf_pooled_p25` **in-sample**? Present the RMSE.

5.	How well does your linear regression predict `krf_pooled_p25` **out-of-sample**? Present the RMSE.

6.	Implement a decision tree model to predict `krf_pooled_p25` using the code in below (covered in class). Plot the decision tree if possible. What are the main predictors? 

7.	How well does your decision tree predict `krf_pooled_p25` **in-sample**? Present the RMSE.

8.	How well does your decision tree predict `krf_pooled_p25` **out-of-sample**? Present the RMSE.

9. Which model performs a better prediction?


## Data Description {-}

The total data (`train` + `test`) consist of n = 73,278 U.S. Census tracts.  For more details on the construction of the variables included in this data set, please see [Chetty, Raj, John Friedman, Nathaniel Hendren, Maggie R. Jones, and Sonya R. Porter. 2018. “The Opportunity Atlas: Mapping the Childhood Roots of Social Mobility.”](https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/atlas_paper.pdf), NBER Working Paper No. 25147.

## Cheatsheat commands  {- #cheatsheetproject3}

**R command	Description**

### How to tell R that you have a categorical variable? {-}

Recall that if you modify one variable in one data set, you should do the same on the other one as well (datasets are `train` and `test`)

Below `X` is just a placeholder for the actual variable you want to converto into a factor. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
atlas_train$X<-as.factor(atlas_train$X)
```

###  Load package {-}

You will need three new packages for this project. Remember to install them first. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("caret")
install.packages("rpart")
install.packages("rpart.plot")
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
```

### Run regression {-}

As before, I have written a whole section explaining regression in more detail: Section \@ref(regression). Please see that for further details. But here is a quick help.

1. Multivariate linear regression

You might want to understand the relationship between `yvar` and variable `xvar1` **while holding fixed** another variable `xvar2` for neighborhoods only in Milwaukee. You can do this: 

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
mod2 <- lm(yvar~xvar1+xvar2 + xvar3, data = train)
```

You would see the output from the model by running:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
summary(mod2)
```

### Measures of accuracy in prediction in a Multiple regression {-}

To assess how good is your model at predicting the outcome, you can use the Root Mean Square Error measurement. That will take the error in the prediction for each observation, square it, average it, and then take the root of that.

You can estimate this measure **in-sample** (within the `train` dataset), or **out-of-sample** (for the `test` dataset). 

To do it **in-sample**, you can calculate it by checking the prediction directly from the estimated linear model:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
sqrt(mean(mod2$residuals^2))
```

where `residuals` is the error that the model predicts for each observation`

To do it **out-of-sample**, you need to use the function `predict` that requires a model, and a dataset with the same variables for the prediction. In this case, you would do something like this: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
predict_mlr_model<-predict(mlr_model,test)
```

and then you can do this: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
actual_values<- test$kfr_pooled_p25
rmse_mlrmodel_outsample <- sqrt(mean((actual_values - predict_mlr_model)^2, na.rm=TRUE))
rmse_mlrmodel_outsample
```

### Estimating a Decision Tree {-}

To estimate the decision tree, you can choose which variables you want to select for the prediction by listing them as before. Say, you want to use x1, x2 and x3 for the prediction, you can do:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tree <- rpart(kfr_pooled_p25 ~x1+x2+x3, data = train)
```

If you wan to use all other variables for the prediction, you can do: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tree <- rpart(kfr_pooled_p25 ~., data = train)
```

To plot the tree you estimated, just do this: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Plotting the regression tree
rpart.plot(tree)
```

### Measures of accuracy in a Decision Tree {-}

The measurement is the same, but to calculate it you need to do use the `predict` function as before. For **in-sample** prediction you would do: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#In-sample prediction
p <- predict(tree, train)
#Root mean squared error = 1944.108 (in sample)
sqrt(mean((train$kfr_pooled_p25-p)^2))
```


For **out-of-sample** prediction, you can run: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pred_tree_outofsample<-predict(tree,test)
#RMSE out of sample = 5965.278
sqrt(mean((test$kfr_pooled_p25-pred_tree_outofsample)^2, na.rm=TRUE ))
```
